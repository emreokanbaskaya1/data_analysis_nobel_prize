# Nobel Prize Data Analysis Using Python

## Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed Nobel Prize winners' data to identify patterns and insights regarding the distribution of awards among countries, genders, and categories over time. The analysis was performed using Python, and the results were visualized using Power BI. The project files included in the repository are:

- `database.csv`
- `python_analysis.ipynb`
